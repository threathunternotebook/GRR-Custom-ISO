# GRR-Custom-ISO
The file in this repo presents a method for creating a GRR custom ISO. The goals for the custom ISO are:
1. Deploy to an ESXi server without any user intervention
2. Deploy to an offline ESXi server
3. Add the GRR Debian package
4. Add packages required for GRR, Nginx, and Ansible 

Once the custom ISO is complete, we should have the capability of installing and configuring GRR and an Nginx frontend to an offline ESXi server using Ansible playbooks.
